Java-7:
      Underscore in NUmerical Literals --> 1_00_000
      Strings in Switch   --> case "VINODH" 
      Try-resource, where try block having resource which will be automatically closed --> try(Fileopen streams, Buffer opens ...){ } 
      Exception in single catch separatere by PIPE(|)--> catch(firstException | second Exception ... e)
      
      
Java-8:
      Lambda Expression ==> p->sysout("Hello");
      Functional Interfaces  ==> @FunctionalInterface with only one abstract method
      Method Refrences  ==> Other of Lamdas calling methods (System.out:: Println)
      Streams ==> Flow like water in pipe & do operations like assemby line:   sourceAsCollection.stream(***).filter(***).map(***).foreach(***)
      Default methods in Interface ==> reversed() method to sort in reverse order of collection
      
 Classic: 
        Generic & Collections ---> List<String>
        Anonymous classes    --> Unkown instance for an Interface   new Thread(){ // unimplemented methoda };
