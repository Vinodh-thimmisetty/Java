Killing Feature of Git => diverge everything from original main line && can be merged later

git branch ==> list all existing branch
 *will be prefixed to working or checedkout branch

git branch -v ==> last commits in all branches
git branch --merged ==> all merged 
git branch --no--merged ==> un merged & will not allow to delete this branches untill merged to master
 
 git branch -d testing ==> deleting the testing branch
  
git branch ** new branch name ==> New branch creation 
git checkout ** branch name *** ==> HEAD will point to workgin directory

combining above two ==> git checkout -b ** branch name ***

Merge your branch changes to MASTER
	1. git checkout master
	2. git merge ** your branch **
If common ancestor commit is not direct then a new commit snapshot will be created for MERGE else just master & your branch will point to same snapshot
